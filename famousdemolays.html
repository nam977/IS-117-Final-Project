                        Walt Disney (1901–1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, and filmmaker
                        who revolutionized the entertainment industry. He co-founded The Walt Disney
                        Company, which became a global leader in animated films, theme parks, and
                        family entertainment. Known for his creativity and innovation, Disney
                        introduced iconic characters like Mickey Mouse and produced beloved classics
                        such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first full-length animated
                        feature film. He also pioneered the concept of theme parks with Disneyland,
                        creating immersive experiences for visitors of all ages. Disney's legacy
                        continues to influence the entertainment world through his company's ongoing
                        success.

                        Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States, served from 1993 to 2001.
                        A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first president from the Baby Boomer
                        generation. Clinton's administration was marked by strong economic growth,
                        including a balanced federal budget and budget surpluses. Domestically, he signed
                        significant legislation such as the Family and Medical Leave Act and welfare
                        reform while promoting policies aimed at expanding global trade, including NAFTA.
                        Clinton also played a prominent role in international diplomacy, including efforts
                        to broker peace in the Middle East and in Northern Ireland. Before his presidency,
                        he served as the Governor of Arkansas, where he focused on education reform and
                        economic development

                        Neil Armstrong (1930–2012) was an American astronaut, aerospace engineer, and test
                        pilot best known as the first human to set foot on the Moon. On July 20, 1969, he
                        commanded NASA's Apollo 11 mission, delivering his iconic phrase, "That's one small
                        step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Armstrong's achievement marked a
                        historic milestone in space exploration. Before joining NASA, he served as a naval
                        aviator during the Korean War and later became a test pilot, flying experimental
                        aircraft like the X-15. Following his astronaut career, Armstrong worked as a
                        professor of aerospace engineering and remained a strong advocate for science and
                        space exploration.

                        John Steinbeck (1902–1968) was an American author and Nobel laureate renowned for his powerful
                        and socially conscious novels. His works often explored themes of human struggle, social justice,
                        and the resilience of ordinary people during challenging times. Steinbeck's most famous works
                        include The Grapes of Wrath, which chronicles the hardships of migrant workers during the Great
                        Depression, Of Mice and Men, a poignant tale of friendship and dreams, and East of Eden, an epic
                        family saga. His storytelling combined vivid descriptions of rural America with deep empathy for
                        his characters, cementing his legacy as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century.
