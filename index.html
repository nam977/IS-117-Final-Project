            <h3> Dad Frank S. Land: Our Founder </h3>

            <div class="frank-land-paragraphs">
                <p>
                    Frank S. Land, affectionately known as "Dad" Land, was a visionary leader whose life
                    was a testament to the power of mentorship and selfless service. Born in Kansas City,
                    Missouri, in 1890, Land grew up with a strong sense of community and compassion.
                    His early years as a "Boy Preacher" and his commitment to artistic pursuits at the
                    Kansas City Art Institute showcased his dedication to enriching the lives of those
                    around him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This unwavering commitment led to his involvement with the Scottish Rite,
                    where he began to make a profound impact. In 1919, a chance encounter with a young
                    man mourning the loss of his father inspired Land to create the Order of DeMolay,
                    a Masonic youth organization focused on character building, leadership, and fellowship.
                    What began as a small group of young men quickly grew into a global fraternity that
                    has positively shaped the lives of millions.

            <p class="freemasonry-paragraph">
                Freemasonry is one of the world's oldest fraternal organizations,
                rooted in traditions of brotherhood, moral and self-improvement.
                Originating from the stonemason guilds of the Middle Ages, it evolved into a society
                that uses allegory and symbolism, often centered on the tools of masonry, to impart
                lessons on ethics, integrity, and the pursuit of knowledge. Freemasonry is not a
                religion but encourages its members to uphold faith in a higher power and live by
                principles of charity, truth, and mutual respect.

                The Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (AAONMS), commonly
                known as the Shriners, is a philanthropic fraternal organization established
                in 1872 in NYC. Rooted in Masonic principles, the Shriners combine
                these values with a more social atmosphere. Known for their distinctive
                red fezzes and commitment to charity, the Shriners are perhaps best recognized
                for their work through Shriners Hospitals for Children, a network of facilities
                providing specialized medical care regardless of a family’s ability to pay.

                The Scottish Rite is an appendant body of Freemasonry, offering additional
                degrees that expand upon the foundational teachings of the Blue Lodge.
                The Rite is organized into two main branches: the Northern and Southern
                Jurisdictions in the United States, each with unique administrative
                structures and rituals. Beyond its educational focus, the Scottish Rite is
                actively involved in charitable work, supporting initiatives such as
                children's language disorder clinics and scholarships.
